<font size="+2.6">Detection of Non-Random Behavior for Resilient Coordination of Robotic Swarms</font>

<p style="font-size:16.8px;">Within robotics, multi-agent system coordination and swarming have long been 
  studied, but have regained consideration attention to consider safety and 
  security issues. Most multi-agent applications are designed without considering 
  cyber-security issues, which perform operations with the assumption that all 
  agents are cooperating. We propose a monitoring framework for multi-agent systems 
  that detects and isolates compromised vehicles to enable the swarm to resiliently 
  continue operations in the presence of stealthy communications and sensor attacks. 
  Our paper has recently been accepted to the IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO) to be published within
  a Special Issue on Resilience in Networked Robotic Systems <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lo8p6Q-6jfJ2I4PlddqhCsTKIx81qHJ0/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a>.

  Additional simulation and experiment results of our resilient multi-agent 
  framework can be found in the following <a href="https://www.bezzorobotics.com/tro21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>.
