<p style="font-size:13px"><span style="font-size:14px"><b>Abstract:</b></span> Malicious attacks on modern autonomous cyber-physical systems (CPSs) can leverage information about the system dynamics and noise characteristics to hide while hijacking the system toward undesired states. Given attacks attempting to hide within the system noise profile to remain undetected, an attacker with the intent to hijack a system will alter sensor measurements, contradicting with what is expected by the system's model. To deal with this problem, in this paper we present a framework to detect non-randomness in sensor measurements on CPSs under the effect of sensor attacks. Specifically, we propose a run-time monitor that leverages two statistical tests, the <i>Wilcoxon Signed-Rank</i> test and <i>Serial Independence Runs</i> test to detect inconsistent patterns in the measurement data. For the proposed statistical tests we provide formal guarantees and bounds for attack detection. We validate our approach through simulations and experiments on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) under stealthy attacks and compare our framework with other anomaly detectors.</p>
    
Today's autonomous cyber-physical systems are fitted with multiple 
on-board sensors and computers, allowing for increased capabilities 
in various applications to perform complex tasks. Consequently, 
these enhancements increase the risk of cyber attackers to spoofing 
attacks that can compromise system integrity and safety. With a growing 
number of vulnerable entry points for attackers on progressively 
impactful systems within our society, it is imperative to develop more 
strict security measures to ensure proper performance.</p>

<p style="font-size:16.8px;">Intelligent attackers are able to implement stealthy attack sequences 
  that hide within system uncertainties in order to remain hidden from 
  typical state-of-the-art detection techniques. However, to effectively 
  hijack a system, an attack must create behavior anomalies (i.e., non-randomness) 
  that contradict the known system model(s). We develop attack detectors 
  that are able to discover non-random events due to sensor cyber-attacks 
  in residual-based detection schemes. With our proposed attack detectors 
  implemented on-board a system, we show that previously undetectable 
  attacks can now be found. More details about our approaches with simulation 
  and experiment results can be found in our papers. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9147412" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[ACC '20]</a>,

<!-- Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    ---
    layout: page
    title: project
    description: a project with a background image
    img: /assets/img/12.jpg
    ---
-->


<!-- You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<!--The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above: -->

<!-- {% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %} -->
