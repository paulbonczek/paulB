<font size="+2.6">Memoryless Cumulative Sign Detector for Stealthy CPS Sensor Attacks</font>
<br/>

Stealthy false data injection attacks on cyber-physical systems introduce erroneous measurements onto sensors with the intent to degrade system performance. An intelligent attacker can design stealthy attacks with knowledge of the system model and noise characteristics to evade detection from state-of-the-art fault detectors by remaining within detection thresholds. However, during these hidden attacks, an attacker with the intention of hijacking a system will leave traces of non-random behavior that contradict with the expectation of the system model. Given these premises, in this paper we propose a run-time monitor called Cumulative Sign (CUSIGN) detector, for identifying stealthy falsified measurements by identifying if measurements are no longer behaving in a random manner. Specifically, our proposed CUSIGN monitor considers the changes in sign of the measurement residuals and their expected occurrence in order to detect if a sensor could be compromised.  Moreover, our detector is designed to be a memoryless procedure, eliminating the need to store large sequences of data for attack detection. We characterize the detection capabilities of the proposed CUSIGN technique following the well-known chi-square failure detection scheme. Additionally, we show the advantage of augmenting CUSIGN to the model-based Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) detector, which provides magnitude bounds on attacks, for enhanced detection of sensor spoofing attacks. Our approach is validated with simulations on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) during a navigation case study.


Today's cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are fitted with multiple on-board sensors and computers that make them capable of many civilian and military applications with minimal/no human supervision. Autonomous navigation, transportation, surveillance, and task oriented jobs are becoming more common and ready for deployment in real world applications especially in the automotive, industrial, and military domains. These various enhancements in autonomy are possible thanks to the tight interaction between computation, sensing, communications, and actuation that characterize CPSs. With these increasing capabilities, comes the risk of more security vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks like sensor spoofing with the intent to induce undesired system behavior. An example of this problem was demonstrated by authors in in which GPS data were spoofed to slowly drive a yacht off the intended route. 

Many systems, including vehicle technologies, typically have well studied dynamical models and their sensors have specific expected behaviors according to their characterized noise profiles. Malicious attackers aim to compromise a system by diverting system states to unsafe regions, while remaining hidden within system detection boundaries. Despite lying within magnitude boundaries to remain undetected, non-random patterns arise that violate the expected behavior from normal system behavior. For example an attacker with the intention of hijacking an autonomous system while remaining stealthy will manipulate sensor measurements pushing them toward one direction.
