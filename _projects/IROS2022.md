<font size="+2.6">Resilient Detection and Recovery of Autonomous Systems Operating under On-board Controller Cyber Attacks</font>
<br/>

<p style="font-size:13px"><span style="font-size:14px"><b>Abstract:</b></span> Cyber-attacks, failures, and implementation errors inside the controller 
  of an autonomous system can affect its correct behavior leading to unsafe states and degraded performance. In this paper we focus on such problems 
  specifically on cyber-attacks that manipulate controller parameters like the gains in a feedback controller or that triggers different behaviors or 
  block inputs based on specific values of the state and tracking error. If such attacks are undetected they can lead to the partial or complete loss of 
  system's control authority hijacking and leading the autonomous system towards unforeseen states. To deal with this problem, we propose a runtime 
  monitoring and recovery scheme in which: 1) we leverage the residual between the expected and the received measurements to detect inconsistencies in 
  the generated inputs and 2) provide a recovery method for counteracting the malicious effects to allow for resilient operations by manipulating the 
  reference signal provided to the system and avoid the affected regions in the state and error space. We validate our approach with extensive Matlab 
  simulations and experiments on unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) resiliently performing operations in the presence of malicious attacks to on-board controllers.</p>
