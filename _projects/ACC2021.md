<font size="+2.6">Detection of Hidden Attacks on Cyber-Physical Systems from Serial Magnitude and Sign Randomness Inconsistencies</font>
<br/>

Stealthy false data injection attacks on cyber-physical systems (CPSs) introduce erroneous measurement information to on-board sensors with the purpose to degrade system performance. An intelligent attacker is able to leverage knowledge of the system model and noise characteristics to alter sensor measurements while remaining undetected. Consequently, an attacker that wants to remain hidden from traditional detection techniques will leave behind traces of serial inconsistencies. 

We assume a system employs a chi-square fault detection procedure that monitors the magnitude and signed sequence of its chi-square test measure.
