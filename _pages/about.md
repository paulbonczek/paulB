<p style="font-size:16px;">  
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the University of Virginia. I work in the <a href="https://www.bezzorobotics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) Lab</a> and <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link Lab</a> under the advisement of Prof. <a href="https://www.bezzorobotics.com/nicola-bezzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicola Bezzo</a>. Before joining the AMR Lab, I obtained my B.S. degree dual majoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics at the State University of New York (SUNY) Polytechnic Institute in 2016.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;">Currently, my research focuses on cyber-physical system cyber-security, 
runtime attack detection algorithms, and resilient control and planning of single- and multi-agent 
  autonomous systems. Other research topics that I find interesting and would like to explore in the 
  future include: adaptive control systems, learning algorithms for robots, machine learning / artificial 
  intelligence, and predictive modeling of financial markets.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;">Within the AMR Lab, our research focuses on how to make cyber-physical systems (which include aerial and mobile ground vehicles) resilient to various adverse environments while operating autonomously. Take a look at the lab <a href="https://www.bezzorobotics.com/">website</a> to see the research performed by the other graduate student members of the lab. The research performed in the AMR Lab was highlighted in a VIRGINIA magazine article in 2017, which can be found <a href="https://uvamagazine.org/articles/robot_take_the_wheel">here</a> and also in a video shoot introducing SPOT, which is the newest addition to the lab.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;">Outside of doing research, I enjoy cooking (especially grilling by the pool), hiking, playing/watching sports, scuba diving, fantasy football, and learning about WWII history. 
An overview of my interests and accomplishments academically, professionally, and personally are here for you to check out.</p>
